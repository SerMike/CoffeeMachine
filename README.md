# Coffee Machine Project

This is a simple Python project that simulates a coin-operated coffee machine. It was created as a learning exercise and represents my first small project uploaded to GitHub.

## Project Description

The Coffee Machine project is a command-line application that simulates the operation of a coffee vending machine. It allows users to select from a menu of drinks, process payment, and dispense the chosen beverage if there are sufficient resources.

## Features

- Menu with three drink options: espresso, latte, and cappuccino
- Resource management (water, milk, coffee)
- Coin processing (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies)
- Change calculation and return
- Option to view current resource levels and profit

## Files

- `main.py`: Contains the main logic for the coffee machine operation
- `ingredients.py`: Stores the menu and resource information

## How to Use

1. Run `main.py`
2. Choose a drink from the menu (espresso/latte/cappuccino) or type 'report' to view resource levels
3. Insert coins as prompted
4. Enjoy your coffee!

## Commands

- `espresso/latte/cappuccino`: Order a drink
- `report`: View current resource levels and profit
- `off`: Turn off the coffee machine

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I practiced:
- Working with dictionaries and functions in Python
- Implementing a command-line interface
- Managing program state and resources
- Handling user input and providing appropriate outputs

## Future Improvements

- Add a graphical user interface
- Implement more drink options
- Create a resource refill function

Feel free to explore the code and suggest any improvements!
